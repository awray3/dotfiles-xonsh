This folder contains xonsh scripts (either .xsh or .py) files that will be
loaded into the environment. They fall broadly into two categories.

## General Purpose

These are ease-of-life scripts, things like this.
	
	alias pr="cd ~/path/to/projects"
	export EDITOR="nvim"

This is more-or-less editor configuration.

## Work-Related

These configurations/objects are created to make accessing work-related data
easier. They probably contain company secrets and therefore should not be
checked into version control!
